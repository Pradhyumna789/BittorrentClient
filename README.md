# BittorrentClient

## Project Abstract

#### This project is a from-scratch implementation of a BitTorrent client. It explores the inner workings of the BitTorrent protocol — a widely used peer-to-peer protocol for efficient distribution of large files.

#### Throughout the project, the client evolves from a basic bencode parser to a fully functioning downloader capable of communicating with peers, fetching file metadata via magnet links, and downloading complete files piece by piece.

✅ Bencode decoding (strings, integers, lists, and dictionaries)
✅ Torrent file parsing and info hash computation
✅ Piece hash verification for data integrity
✅ Peer discovery via trackers
✅ BitTorrent peer handshake and messaging
✅ Piece and file download implementation
✅ Magnet link parsing and metadata exchange
✅ Extension protocol handshake and metadata retrieval

I'm building this to deepen my understanding of peer-to-peer networking protocols, binary data handling, and stateful networked systems.
